/** Map a user-picked folder to the git toplevel git would actually use
 *  if we ran `git worktree …` inside it.
 *
 *  Three outcomes — see `AddRepoResult` in shared/repo-pick.ts for the
 *  matching renderer-facing shape:
 *
 *  - 'ok' — picked is itself a git repo root; safe to register as-is.
 *  - 'walked-up' — picked has no `.git`, but git's upward discovery
 *    found a real repo at `resolved`. Caller must surface both paths
 *    to the user before registering, otherwise we silently end up
 *    managing whatever ancestor (often `$HOME`) happens to be a repo.
 *  - 'not-a-repo' — git can't find a repository anywhere up the tree.
 *
 *  Both sides are passed through `realpath` before comparing so the
 *  macOS `/private` symlink prefix doesn't trip a spurious walk-up.

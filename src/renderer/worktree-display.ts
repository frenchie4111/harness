 *       path relative to the standard worktrees root; falls back to the
 *       absolute path for worktrees at non-standard locations. This is
 *       the "peek behind the alias" affordance — non-aliased rows never
 *       change under Cmd, since they already show the branch.
 *    2. Otherwise, the `alias` if defined.
 *    3. Otherwise, `worktree.branch`.
 *
 *  Machine-facing surfaces (git commands, PR merge headers, API URLs)
 *  MUST NOT use this helper — they need the real branch. Callers pass
 *  the alias string, not the whole aliases map, so per-id subscription
 *  hooks (`useAliasForPath`) can be used to avoid whole-slice re-render
 *  fan-out (CLAUDE.md anti-pattern #4). */
